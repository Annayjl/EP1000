    <p><b>About this wesbite:</b>
   
  <br>This website shows a brief introduction about me so I shall share some facts about me, I am a DIT student in Information Technology, I am in SP SANDA and this elective module was not what I was expecting but it is always good to challenge myself with something new. I did this simple website with the help of w3schools, highly recommend it for people who are learning HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP.<br> Do enjoy your stay here :)  </p>
