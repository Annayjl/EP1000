   <p class="inset" style="margin-left:30px; margin-right: 30px; font-size: larger;">This website shows a brief introduction about me so I shall share some facts about me, I am a DIT student in Information Technology, I am in SP SANDA and this elective module was not what I was expecting but it is always good to challenge myself with something new. I did this simple website with the help of w3schools, highly recommend it for people who are learning HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP. Do enjoy your stay here :) </p>
