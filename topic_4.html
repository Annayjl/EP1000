              <h1 >Intro to CREATE AND VIEW A WEB PAGE ON YOUR COMPUTER</h1>
              
              <p>When you navigate to a web page on the Internet, the browser is doing a lot of work. The browser reads all the necessary files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and interprets those raw resources to paint the complex page you see.</p>
                
              <br>

              <h1>REQUIREMENTS:</h1>
                
                <ul>
                <li>Text Editor</li>
                <li>An Internet Browser</li>
                <li>Check out W3SCHOO</li>
                </ul>

                <li> <b>STEP 1: OPEN YOUR TEXT EDITOR</b></li>
                <p>The first step is to open your text editor. It’s important to use a “raw” text editor, and not a formatted word processor.</p>
               <br> 
               <li> <b>STEP 2: WRITE YOUR HTML</b></li>
               <p>Now that your text editor is open, you can begin writing your HTML. As you learned in the first lesson of the HTML & CSS course, there are a few things that are always present in a well-formatted HTML file. Here’s all of them together again:</p>
              <br> <img src="Image/html_1.PNG">
              <p>Just copy and paste it into your text editor. Make sure you include everything!</p>
              <li> <b>STEP 3: SAVE YOUR FILE</b></li>
              <p>Your web page is now ready, but currently it only exists inside of your text editor. The next step is to save the file to your computer. If you closed the text editor now without saving, your new web page would be lost!</p>
             <br> 
             <li> <b>STEP 4: OPEN YOUR WEB PAGE IN YOUR BROWSER</b></li>
             <p>Now you’re ready to view your new page in your browser! First, open up your browser. In the top menu, click File > Open File. Navigate to the location you saved your web page. Click on your web page file and then click Open. You should see your web page!</p>
            <br>
